            <h2>A project that aims to make studying more fun.</h2>
            <p>I started this project around 2022, with one goal: to make studying more fun, and therefore learning more accessible. Most schools see videogames as a problem, which is what I want to change. When used right, games become a tool, rather than a distraction, and this is something a lot of schools haven't acknowledged. Our school system has had minimal changes over the past 100 years, while everything else has been changed in its entireity. In recent years, this has changed, due to COVID-19, but it may be headed in the wrong direction, just simply doing exactly what we did before but online. <b>This</b> is what Game2Study is here for. We incorporate videogames with assignments and study guides so students don't feel forced to study, but happy to. The only way to make sure students don't play videogames they aren't supposed to is to make videogames better, that they <b>are</b> supposed to.</p>
